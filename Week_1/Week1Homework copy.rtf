\f0\fs48 \cf0 I have found that the difference between a GLI and a CLI is very similar to the difference of an average diner. What the customer and regular citizen is going to see is a clean and put together environment showcasing only the finished product as it makes its way to your table. Whereas the back of house is going to be a little more deconstructed. A place where you can see the inner workings of how your food is made. In reality, GLI is going to primary use buttons and icons very similar to a keyboard. GUI is going to be more user friendly and will allow the style of a UI or OS shine through. A CLI or the Command Line Interface is going to look like what you imagine hacking to be. It will be filled text commands and allows for greater control over your system if the user knowledge has been established. You will use these commands like you would with the button and icons of a GLI. They will help you operate and navigate through the terminal.}
